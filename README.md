# threejs_script_tags_NON_es6_ldraw_loader

## Project Structure

This project was initially developed using ES6 modules for better modularity and ease of maintenance. For broader compatibility and to eliminate the need for a build step, I converted the module imports to use script tags. This approach allows the project to be directly included in web pages without requiring a module bundler.
